## Branch Description
### Final Project:  Predicting Player Fantasy Points using a Random Forest Regression Model
Collected data from pro-football-reference.com on the main Offensive positions.  The last year of data for each player and position was removed and stored in a secondary dataframe.  This last year of data was then separated into features and labels, where the features were then run through the trained Random Forest Model.  Then the model was run on the secondary dataframe and compared to the secondary features to get the actual accuracy of the model on non-trained data.  Decision Tree snippets were produced and included in the repository as PNG files.
