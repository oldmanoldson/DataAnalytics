## Branch Description
### Homework 3:  Ford Ka Case - Unsupervised Learning Analysis
Unsupervised Machine learning work primarily using clustering analysis, specifically K-mean Clustering.  This type of clustering was chosen because the data was spherical and lent itself to K-means.  The jupyter notebook includes all steps of clustering analysis, data visualizations, elbow method etc.  A probability analysis was also performed to determine who the likely buyers of the vehicles were and associating that analysis with the defined clusters.  The case write-up is also found in the branch.
