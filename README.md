### Homework 4:  Bankruptcy Data - Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest for Classification
Ensemble learning methodology to compare the accuracy of logistic regression versus Random Forest to classify and predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on financial factors.  The first half of the jupyter notebook is the logistic regression and the second half is the Random Forest model.  Validation was also done using ROC curves, with Stratified-K cross validation done to validate the Random Forest model.  Data Visualizations are also found within the notebook, as well as the analysis write-up.
