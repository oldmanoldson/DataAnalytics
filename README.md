## Branch Descriptions
### Homework 2:  Regression Analysis - A Supervised Learning Approach
Supervised Machine Learning work in linear and logistic regression.  The jupyter notebook includes all steps of the analysis from data exploration to correlation matrices, Recursive Feature Elimination-Cross Validation analysis, and the machine learning techniques for the actual regression analysis.  The analysis write-up is found within the branch.

### Homework 3:  Ford Ka Case - Unsupervised Learning Analysis
Unsupervised Machine learning work primarily using clustering analysis, specifically K-mean Clustering.  This type of clustering was chosen because the data was spherical and lent itself to K-means.  The jupyter notebook includes all steps of clustering analysis, data visualizations, elbow method etc.  A probability analysis was also performed to determine who the likely buyers of the vehicles were and associating that analysis with the defined clusters.  The case write-up is also found in the branch.

### Homework 4:  Bankruptcy Data - Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest for Classification
Ensemble learning methodology to compare the accuracy of logistic regression versus Random Forest to classify and predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt based on financial factors.  The first half of the jupyter notebook is the logistic regression and the second half is the Random Forest model.  Validation was also done using ROC curves, with Stratified-K cross validation done to validate the Random Forest model.  Data Visualizations are also found within the notebook, as well as the analysis write-up.

### Oakland Case:  Mark Nobel Contract Analysis - A Supervised Learning Approach
This analysis was done to determine what drives ticket prices at Oakland A's games during the 1980 season and using that information to determine a fair contract to offer pitcher Mark Nobel during contract renegotiations.  Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the driving factors behind ticket sales.  In an associated excel file, Oakland A's revenue and ticket sales were tracked and correlated with what Mark Nobel was supposedly bringing in to show his approxiamte ticket revenue per game.  The analysis was written up and is available in the associated word document.
