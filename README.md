### Oakland Case:  Mark Nobel Contract Analysis - A Supervised Learning Approach
This analysis was done to determine what drives ticket prices at Oakland A's games during the 1980 season and using that information to determine a fair contract to offer pitcher Mark Nobel during contract renegotiations.  Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the driving factors behind ticket sales.  In an associated excel file, Oakland A's revenue and ticket sales were tracked and correlated with what Mark Nobel was supposedly bringing in to show his approxiamte ticket revenue per game.  The analysis was written up and is available in the associated word document.
